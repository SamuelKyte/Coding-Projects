Task 2

1.) An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then

stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the

algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,

World”.



Create variable for first name by requesting user’s first name

Display first name + “Hello World.”
.
.
.
.
.
first_name = input('Please enter your first name: ')
print('Hello {first_name}, and Hello World!')





2.) An algorithm that asks a user to enter their age and then stores

their age in a variable called age. Subsequently, the algorithm

should print out “You’re old enough” if the user’s age is over or

equal to 18, or print out “Almost there” if the age is equal to or over

16, but less than 18. Finally, the algorithm should print out “You’re

just too young” if the user is younger than (and not equal to) 16



Create age variable by Requesting users age --------> age = input('Please enter your age: ')

	If age >=18:

		Display “You’re old enough”

	Else if >=16 but not >=18:

		Display  “Almost there”

	Else:
	Display “You’re just too young...”



Bonus: 

Create variable n by requesting positive number from user.
