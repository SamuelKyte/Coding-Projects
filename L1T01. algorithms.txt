 Inside pseudo.txt, write pseudo code for each of the following scenarios:


1.) An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input.

Request positive number from user

If number = 0 

 Display four of largest integers from list

Else:

Request another positive number from user and add to list



2.) An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

Request list of numbers from user

Calculate average = (Sum of variables) / number of variables 

Display average of user list



3.) An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

Request grocery list from user

Alphabetize/sort list 

Display list

Request user for items collected:
	If entered item corresponds with the list:
		Remove collected item from list
		Display updated list

	Else: 
	Display "Item not found in list"




4.) From Flow Chart:

Request X from user
Request Y from user

Calculate S=X+Y

Calculate A=S/2

Calculate P=X * Y

Display S, A, P
