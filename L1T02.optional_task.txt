Bonus: Write the pseudocode for the algorithm
that asks the user for a number and stores that number in a variable
called n. Then the algorithm should calculate and print out the first n

If user enters 0
	Display 0

Else if user enters 1:
	Display 0, 1

Else generate fibonacci of n to the nth indexed place.
