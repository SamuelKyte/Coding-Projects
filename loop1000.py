 # I'm not sure if this was what the assignment was looking for or if it was asking if I could print 0-1000 and then print the even numbers seperately?

 # First, I created a for loop to print a range of numbers (in two lines of code). Then I edited the code within the for loop to only print the even numbers.

for all in range(0,1001):
        if all%2==0:
              print(all)
