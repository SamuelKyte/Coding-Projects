Identify P(A) and P(A and B):

Risk Analysis: 
You work for a risk analysis insurer. You have read that, this year, out of all drivers on the road, 5% have had accidents under the age of 25. You have also read that 10% of all drivers are under the age of 25. A new client approaches you and states that their age is 22. You want to calculate the chance that this driver has had an accident this year, based on their age.

Event A = has had an accident. # hypothesis
Event B = age is less than 25. # evidence

P(B) = 0.1, P(A and B) = 0.05. # probability of Event B
P(A|B) = 0.5 # probability of Event A given Event B

Coin Flip: 
Your friend told you that they would buy you lunch, if you can flip a coin and have it land on heads twice. You flip it the first time, and it lands on heads. What are your chances now of it landing on heads again?

Event A = coin lands on Heads on second flip. 
Event B = coin lands on Heads on first flip. 

P(B) = 0.5 # probability of Event B
P(A and B) = 0.25
P(A|B) = 0.5 # probability of Event A given Event B

Achieving Marks: 
You were always told that knowing Maths helps you to achieve an 80 in Computer Science. You read some statistics, showing that 30% of all Computer Science graduates took Maths and achieved an 80. Overall, 60% of all Computer Science graduates took Maths. Considering you took Maths, what are your chances of achieving an 80?

Event A = Achieving an 80
Event B = doing Maths

P(B) = 0.6 # probability of Event B
P(A and B) = 0.3
P(A|B) = 0.5 # probability of Event A given Event B


Part 2:
●  This is a mock study created using a total of 100 participants.
●  The two orange areas show the total number of people who actually have COVID, and the two blue areas show the total number of people who don’t actually have COVID.
●  The two darkly-coloured areas at the bottom show the people who tested positive for COVID. The two lightly-coloured areas show the people who tested negative for COVID.
●  Using this diagram, and information learned from the video, state the following:
○ H: our hypothesis
○ E: our evidence

● Then, give the values for:
○ P(H)
○ P(E|H)
○ P(E)
○ P(H|E)

H = +COVID # we think were positive
E = +COVID # we test positive


P(H) = +COVID / Total = 70 / 100 = 0.7 # probability of hypothesis
P(E|H) = (+COVID and Tested +COVID) / Total = 63 / 100 = 0.63 # probability of evidence, given hypothesis
P(E) = Tested +COVID / Total = 64 / 100 = 0.64 # probability of evidence
P(H|E) = ((P(H))(P(E|H)))/(P(E)) = ((0.7)(0.63))/(0.64) = 0.69 # probability of hypothesis given evidence
